    To check if you have ``uv`` installed, open a terminal and run ``uv --version``.

2. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:vaioic/pospisilik-lab-testes-analysis.git
   cd pospisilik-lab-testes-analysis
   ```

3. Sync the environment (this will setup the correct virtual environment and dependencies)
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

4. Run the analysis
   ```bash
   uv run analysis/analysis_script.py
   ```

#### Using venv and pip

1. Clone the repository
